1. Data Ingestion

Data was sourced and aggregated from multiple enterprise systems and exports:

ERP Exports: Sideline, Agility, and other internal databases

CSV Files: Historical weekly sales and inventory records

SQL Queries and Python Scripts: Used to automate extraction and validation steps

2. Data Cleaning and Alignment

Data was standardized and aligned to ensure quality and consistency:

Timestamp Alignment: All records synchronized to weekly frequency

Gap Imputation: Forward and backward filling to address missing weeks

Outlier Detection: Identified and corrected anomalies using statistical thresholds

SKU Classification: Grouped SKUs by product category and fire-rating codes (20m, 60m, 90m, etc.)

3. Feature Engineering

Time-based features were engineered to capture seasonality and trend behavior:

Lag Features: t-1, t-2 lags to capture short-term memory

Rolling Averages: Weekly and monthly smoothing to model gradual changes

Flags: Week, month, and quarter flags for calendar-based seasonality

4. Modeling

Three model families were implemented and benchmarked:

Model	Description	Purpose
SARIMA	Grid-searched (p,d,q)(P,D,Q,s) parameters using statsmodels	Statistical baseline capturing seasonality and autocorrelation
Prophet	Meta’s changepoint model with automatic trend and season detection	Handles missing data and quick iteration
LSTM	Keras sequential neural network	Explores non-linear patterns in longer time sequences
5. Backtesting and Evaluation

Each model was validated on held-out windows with multiple metrics:

MAE, MSE, RMSE, AIC, BIC

Rolling backtests for robustness across SKUs

Comparative visualizations to identify stability and overfitting

6. Dashboard and Deployment

Outputs were deployed to an interactive dashboard for business users:

Built using JavaScript and Power BI

Includes model selection, hyperparameter sliders, SKU filters, and CSV export

Results and configuration files stored in GitHub for transparency and reproducibility
